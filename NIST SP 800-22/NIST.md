NIST SP 800-22 battery, from National Institute of Standards and Technology, created to approve cryptographic modules.

We show the results for the p-values on the 15 battery tests (17 tests including variants):

- Approximate Entropy
- Block Frequency
- Cumulative Sums (2 p-values)
- FFT
- Frequency
- Linear Complexity
- Longest Run of Ones
- Non Overlapping Template
- Overlapping Template
- Random Excursions
- Random Excursions Variant
- Rank
- Runs
- Serial (2 p-values)
- Universal

We also included results related to the battery without processing invalid data in the Random Excursions and Random Excursions Variant tests.
