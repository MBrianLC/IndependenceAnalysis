FIPS 140-2 battery, a computer security standard from the U.S. government created to approve cryptographic modules.

We show the results for the p-values on the 5 battery tests:

- Monobit
- Poker
- Runs
- Long Run
- Continuous Run

Initially, the battery tests do not return p-values. To make them do so, we have reimplemented the battery.
