ENT battery, created by John Walker. We will use the StringENT extension, developed by Bittor Alaña and supervised by Elena Almaraz and Javier García (Complutense University of Madrid), Julio Hernández-Castro (University of Kent), and Darren Hurley-Smith (Royal Holloway University)

We show the results for the p-values on the 7 battery tests (5 from ENT and 2 new from StringENT):

- Entropy
- Chi-square
- Mean
- Monte Carlo PI
- Serial
- Runs (StringENT test)
- Local Means (StringENT test)
